Core Objectives Met
When a user adds a database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, they are able to connect to a database using Sequelize.
When a user enters schema and seed commands, a development database is created and is seeded with test data.
When a user enters the command to invoke the application, their server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.
When a user opens API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags,the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.
When a user tests API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core, they are able to successfully create, update, and delete data in their database.
Technologies Used
JavaScript
Node.js
NPM Express.js Package
NPM MySQL2 Package
NPM Sequelize Package
NPM DotENV Package
NPM Router Package

Local Installation & Usage
To use this app, you will need a MySQL Workbench account, and to have the app installed on your machine. Documentation with installation instructions are available here.

To test the API routes in this app, you may wish to have an Insomnia account and to have the app installed on your machine. Documentation and instructions are available here.

STEP 1

1.1 Clone this E-Commerce-Back-End repo to your machine.
STEP 2

From Visual Studio Code or the code editor of your choice:

2.1 Open the repo.  
2.2 Locate and open the .env.EXAMPLE file, located in the root directory.
2.3 Add your own MySQL Workbench Username and Password to the env.EXAMPLE file.
2.4 Re-name the file to .env (i.e. remove .EXAMPLE).
2.5 Save your changes.
2.6 Locate and open db\schema.sql.
2.7 Copy and paste the database schema into a new MySQL Workbench query tab and run it. Refresh and view your updated schemas to ensure that ecommerce_db now appears.
STEP 3

From your terminal, run:

3.1 npm i
3.2 npm run watch
STEP 4: API ROUTE TESTS

From your terminal, run:

4.1 npm run seed
From Insomnia:

4.2 Run tests for each API route (GET all, GET by id, PUSH, PUT, and DELETE) route using http://localhost:3001/api/ for each model (Category, Product, and Tag), with pathing listed as categories, products, and tags (i.e. GET http://localhost:3001/api/categories/).
